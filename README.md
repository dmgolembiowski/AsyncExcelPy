# AsyncExcelPy
<h4>Excel and Google Sheets are powerful online tools for manipulating and analyzing tabular data. However, the tool can be limiting in the hands of a developer who wants to define custom functions without the hassle of programming in Visual Basic.</h4>

<h4>(Async)ExcelPy is a web application I'm designed with React, jQuery, and the asynchronous Quart micro-framework because the world needs an open-source alternative to Excel that features functional customization without the restraints of a dead programming language.</h4>
