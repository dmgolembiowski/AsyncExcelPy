# AsyncExcelPy
Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are powerful tools for manipulating and analyzing tabular data. However, the tool can be limiting in the hands of a developer who wants to define custom functions without the hassle of programming in Visual Basic.

(Async)ExcelPy is a web application I'm designing with React, JQuery, and the Quart micro-framework because the world needs an open-source alternative to Excel that features functional customization without the hassle of learning a dead programming language.
